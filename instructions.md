> **Data Follower** is a Machine Learning Web App with Streamlit and Python.
> As an Interactive ML WebApp, this app provides an easy way for nontechnical individuals to using machine learning algorithms.  The process of machine learning would be broken down in the 2 steps listed below. 👋

1. **Model Training** (*Train a machine learning model.*)
	- **Gathering data** : Upload structured data;
	- **Data description** : Variable Description & Statistics;
	- **ML type** : Select target and features to clean and transform data;
	- **Training** : Automatically train and select the optimal model through metrics;
	- **Evaluation** : View and Plot Evaluation Metrics;

2. **Model Application** (*Predictive modeling is a process that uses the well trained model to forecast outcomes.*)
	- **Prediction** : Load the trained model to predict;
	- **Checking** : Load the trained model to analyse;

👈 Select a task from the dropdown on the left.
